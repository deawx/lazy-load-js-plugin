# JSLazyLoading raw JavaScript plugin
JSLazyLoading is a lightweight performance-oriented plugin for lazy loading and multi-serving of images, that is intended for client-side optimization. Written in pure JavaScript, the plugin does not depend on third-party libraries, such as jQuery. The plugin delays the loading of images that are outside the viewport until a user scrolls to their position in the document.

The multi-serving option allows to display images dinamically, according to the device screen width or the device screen density. Retina mode is intended to display high-density images if the device screen density is high enough. In this mode high-quality images are loaded on demand without waiting of entire page load. In contrast, if you want to speed up your site to the maximum and you do not need Retina support, you can set smaller light-weight images to be displayed in mobiles and tablets instead of large images.

This plugin can reduce network traffic and increase page load speed, which is very helpful if a user has slow internet connection. Different client-side and server-side options allow you to optimize the performance and usability of your website. The plugin is compatible with both modern and older browsers, including Internet Explorer 6+.
