# JSLazyLoading
<p>JSLazyLoading is a lightweight performance-oriented plugin for lazy loading and multi-serving of images. Written in pure JavaScript, the plugin does not depend on third-party libraries such as Mootools and jQuery. The plugin delays the loading of images that are outside the viewport until a user scrolls to them.</p>

<p>For mobile devices and tablets, instead of large images intended for desktop browsers, you can set smaller analogue images to be displayed. This can reduce network traffic and increase page load speed. The plugin is compatible with both modern and older browsers, including Internet Explorer 6+.</p>
•You can control the plugin capacity to optimize performance.
•Viewport borders option allows you to determine the shape of a visible area.
•Fade-in effect based on pure CSS3 is a way to show images by fading them to opaque.
•Customizable loader image that is shown while the original image is being loaded.
•Customizable background of the placeholder image.
•You can force image loading that are outside the viewport while a user is viewing the content (images will be loaded at a specified interval).
•Soft mode: the content are not "jumping" as images are being loaded (a browser does not "know" an image dimensions untill the image is loaded, so this effect is normalized).
•AJAX listener allows you to include new images from an AJAX response in the plugin scope. The plugin is compatible with AJAX-based navigation and extensions.
