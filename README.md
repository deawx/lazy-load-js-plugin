# JSLazyLoading
<p>JSLazyLoading is a lightweight performance-oriented plugin for lazy loading and multi-serving of images. Written in pure JavaScript, the plugin does not depend on third-party libraries such as Mootools and jQuery. The plugin delays the loading of images that are outside the viewport until a user scrolls to them.</p>

<p>For mobile devices and tablets, instead of large images intended for desktop browsers, you can set smaller analogue images to be displayed. This can reduce network traffic and increase page load speed. The plugin is compatible with both modern and older browsers, including Internet Explorer 6+.</p>
